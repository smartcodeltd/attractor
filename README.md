# Attractor

Attractor is a new **geo-marketing** app.

**Advertisers** can employ virtual **Attractors** to make **announcements** in the streets of their cities
and advertise **local businesses** and **events**.

**Subscribers** will hear announcements from **nearby Attractors only**,
so youâ€™ll always know when a new coffee shop opens close to you!
